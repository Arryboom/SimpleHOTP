ToDo:
- Arduinoish Examples for every feature
- Update README for every feature with remove
- Update keywords.txt
- Tag Version and publish issue on https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues
- README with simple usage only for HOTP validation (the rest is best described by examples and header files)
